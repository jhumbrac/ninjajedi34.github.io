<p id="goal">Our goal is to teach kids, as young as fourth grade, the fundamentals of basketball.</p>

<p id="main">Who are we? We are the Sammamish High School Girls Basketball Coaches: Mike, Anna, and Becca. We want to start a program that allows young girls in the area to start exploring the sport of basketball. As well as get to know us coaches. We want to create a sense of community between the younger girls and the current high school players, who will be helping to lead a few clinics and camps during the year.</p>

<p>We will be offering a variety of different ways for young girls to come in and learn different skills:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select Teams</li>
	<li>Clinics with Current Totem Players</li>
	<li>Three-Day Camps</li>
	<li>One on One Skills Drills</li>
</ul>
